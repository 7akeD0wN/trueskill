Under development.

- Renames the featured functions:

  - :meth:`TrueSkill.transform_ratings` is now called :meth:`TrueSkill.rate`.
  - :meth:`TrueSkill.match_quality` is now called :meth:`TrueSkill.quality`.

- Adds shorcut functions for 2 players individual match, the most usage:
  :func:`rate_1vs1` and :func:`quality_1vs1`,
- Implements "Partial play".
- Supports that using dictionaries as a ``rating_group`` to choose specific
  player's rating simply.
- Works well in many Python versions, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and many
  interpreters, CPython, `Jython`_, `PyPy`_.
