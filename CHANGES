Version 0.2
-----------

Under development.

- Changes the interface to maximize compatibility with `Elo`_ and `Glicko`_
  other rating system modules:

  - Adding :func:`rate_1vs1` a shortcut to rate 2 players individual match.
  - Adding :func:`quality_1vs1` a shortcut to calculate match quality of 2
    players individual match.
  - :meth:`TrueSkill.transform_ratings` is now called :meth:`TrueSkill.rate`.
  - :meth:`TrueSkill.match_quality` is now called :meth:`TrueSkill.quality`.

- Supports that using dictionaries as a ``rating_group`` to choose specific
  player's rating simply.
- Works well in Python 3 and Python 2.5.
