Version 0.3
-----------

:class:`TrueSkill` got a new option ``backend`` to choose cdf, pdf, ppf
implementation. There are 3 choices; ``None`` -- internal implementation,
scipy_, mpmath_.

When winners have too lower rating than losers, :meth:`TrueSkill.rate` will
raise :exc:`FloatingPointError` if the backend is ``None`` or scipy. This
is reported at `issue #5`_. From this version, you can avoid the problem with
mpmath backend.
