What's TrueSkiil?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`TrueSkill`_ is a rating system among game players. It has been used on `Xbox
Live`_ to rank and match players. TrueSkill system quantizes **TRUE** skill
points by a Bayesian inference algorithm.

With TrueSkill, you can measure players' skill; make the best matches by skill
points; predict who's going to win. And even it works with N:N:N, a multiple
team game even a free-for-all not only 1:1 game.

This project is a Python package which implements TrueSkill rating system.

Learning
~~~~~~~~

Rating, a model for player's skill
----------------------------------

In TrueSkill, rating is a Gaussian distribution. The initial mu (\\(\\mu\\);
mean) of rating is 25 and the initial sigma (\\(\\sigma\\); standard deviation)
is \\(\\frac{ 25 }{ 3 } \\approx 8.333\\):

::

   >>> from trueskill import Rating
   >>> my_player.rating = Rating()
   >>> print my_player.rating
   trueskill.Rating(mu=25.000, sigma=8.333)

1:1 competition game
--------------------

Most competition games follows 1:1 match rule. If your game does, just use
``1vs1`` helpers containing :func:`rate_1vs1` and :func:`quality_1vs1`. These
are very easy to use.

First of all, we need 2 :class:`Rating` objects:

::

    >>> r1 = Rating()  # 1P's skill
    >>> r2 = Rating()  # 2P's skill

Then we can guess match quality which is equivalent with draw probability of
this match using :func:`quality_1vs1`:

::

    >>> print '{:.1%} chance to draw'.format(quality_1vs1(r1, r2))
    44.7% chance to draw

After the game, TrueSkill recalculates their ratings by the game result. For
example, if 1P beats 2P:

::

    >>> new_r1, new_r2 = rate_1vs1(r1, r2)
    >>> print new_r1
    trueskill.Rating(mu=29.396, sigma=7.171)
    >>> print new_e2
    trueskill.Rating(mu=20.604, sigma=7.171)

Mu value follows player's win/draw/lose records. Higher value means higher game
skill. And sigma value follows the number of games. Lower value means many game
plays and higher rating confidence.

So 1P, a winner's skill grew up from 25 to 29.396 but 2P, a loser's skill shrank
to 20.604. And both sigma values became narrow about same magnitude.

Matchmaking
-----------

Draw probability is match quality. If you're making a matchmaking service,
match quality will be helpful:

::

    while should_match:
        r1, r2 = next_match()
        if quality_1vs1(r1, r2) < .30:
            rematch(r1, r2)
            continue
        succeed_match(r1, r2)
        time.sleep(match_interval)
