What's TrueSkiil?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`TrueSkill`_ is a rating system among game players. It has been used on `Xbox
Live`_ to rank and match players. TrueSkill system quantizes **TRUE** skill
points by a Bayesian inference algorithm.

With TrueSkill, you can measure players' skill; make the best matches by skill
points; predict who's going to win. And even it works with N:N:N, a multiple
team game even a free-for-all not only 1:1 game.

This project is a Python package which implements TrueSkill rating system.

Learning
~~~~~~~~

Rating, a model for player's skill
----------------------------------

In TrueSkill, rating is a Gaussian distribution which starts from
\\(\\mathcal{ N }( 25, \\frac{ 25 }{ 3 } )\\). \\(\\mu\\) is an average skill
of player, and \\(\\sigma\\) is a confidence of the guessed rating. A real
skill of player is between \\(\\mu \\pm 2\\sigma\\) with 95% confidence.

::

   >>> from trueskill import Rating
   >>> Rating()  # use the default mu and sigma
   trueskill.Rating(mu=25.000, sigma=8.333)

If some player's rating is higher \\(\\beta\\) than another player's, the
player may have 80% of chance to beat the other player. The default value of
\\(\\beta\\) is \\(\\frac{ 25 }{ 6 }\\).

Ratings will approach real skills through few times of the TrueSkill's Bayesian
inference algorithm.

1:1 competition game
--------------------

Most competition games follows 1:1 match rule. If your game does, just use
``_1vs1`` helpers containing :func:`rate_1vs1` and :func:`quality_1vs1`. These
are very easy to use.

First of all, we need 2 :class:`Rating` objects:

::

    >>> r1 = Rating()  # 1P's skill
    >>> r2 = Rating()  # 2P's skill

Then we can guess match quality which is equivalent with draw probability of
this match using :func:`quality_1vs1`:

::

    >>> print '{:.1%} chance to draw'.format(quality_1vs1(r1, r2))
    44.7% chance to draw

After the game, TrueSkill recalculates their ratings by the game result. For
example, if 1P beats 2P:

::

    >>> new_r1, new_r2 = rate_1vs1(r1, r2)
    >>> print new_r1
    trueskill.Rating(mu=29.396, sigma=7.171)
    >>> print new_e2
    trueskill.Rating(mu=20.604, sigma=7.171)

Mu value follows player's win/draw/lose records. Higher value means higher game
skill. And sigma value follows the number of games. Lower value means many game
plays and higher rating confidence.

So 1P, a winner's skill grew up from 25 to 29.396 but 2P, a loser's skill shrank
to 20.604. And both sigma values became narrow about same magnitude.

Complex competition game
------------------------

There are many other match rules such as N:N team match, N:N:N multiple team
match, N:M unbalanced match, Deathmatch (Player vs. All), and so on. Mostly
other rating systems cannot work with them but TrueSkill does. TrueSkill
accepts any types of matches.

We should arrange ratings into a group by their team:

::

    >>> r1 = Rating()  # 1P's skill
    >>> r2 = Rating()  # 2P's skill
    >>> r3 = Rating()  # 3P's skill
    >>> t1 = [r1]  # Team A contains just 1P
    >>> t2 = [r2, r3]  # Team B contains 2P and 3P

Then we can calculate the match quality and rate them:

::

    >>> print '{:.1%} chance to draw'.format(quality([t1, t2]))
    13.5% chance to draw
    >>> (new_r1,), (new_r2, new_r3) = rate([t1, t2])
    >>> print new_r1
    trueskill.Rating(mu=33.731, sigma=7.317)
    >>> print new_r2
    trueskill.Rating(mu=16.269, sigma=7.317)
    >>> print new_r3
    trueskill.Rating(mu=16.269, sigma=7.317)

Here're varied patterns of rating groups. All variables which start with ``r``
are :class:`Rating` objects:

- N:N team match -- ``[(r1, r2, r3), (r4, r5, r6)]``
- N:N:N multiple team match -- ``[(r1, r2), (r3, r4), (r5, r6)]``
- N:M unbalanced match -- ``[(r1,), (r2, r3, r4)]``
- Deathmatch -- ``[(r1,), (r2,), (r3,), (r4,)]``

Partial play
------------

Some players contribute less than other team memebers.
